        <div class="subheading mb-5">Pre-business Major</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">Hello, my name is Kaylee and I'm a first year pre-business major finishing my year at the University of California, Riverside and I’m looking forward to getting into the marketing department of the Business Administration. My involvement in organizations such as the California Scholarship Federation and being Vice President of the Anime Club has given me extensive experience in behaving in a professional manner and making critical decisions. I have done volunteer work in Environmental Beautification, been an Altar Server in church, and have worked as a Library Assistant which allows me to understand the time and effort it takes to efficiently coordinate and communicate effectively with a team. In high school, I have acquired many awards that apply to my ability to manage my time between clubs, volunteer work, and proficiency in my academics. I am a naturally detail-oriented person and problem solver who has developed great oral and written communication skills. I strongly believe in meeting deadlines and putting your full effort into everything you do, but also being able to distinguish what is imperative and what can be taken care of later. I am prepared and happy to demonstrate a respectful and welcoming demeanor to authoritative figures, coworkers, and persons in need of assistance.

<br><br>

        One of the most important committees that I have dedicated my time to is the First Time College Student Committee which is committed to giving first years a memorable and meaningful experience at the University of California, Riverside. As a member of this committee I now have experience in working with others to organize events with a hundred plus people. I have developed a better understanding of the practical and extensive intricacies that members must plan and prepare in order to create a successful event. These include renting out university property and tools, creating brochures, advertising, getting in contact with other people for permission to do certain activities, and having the proper permits for handling food for events.
<br><br>

        As a Student Lead in the University of California, Riverside Dining Services I have taken the responsibility of managing employees by observing their strengths and weaknesses while performing certain tasks and delegating them accordingly. I constantly look for ways to improve the work ethic of my team members and for ways to create a more positive work environment for maximum productivity and to build teamwork. I believe that motivating the people around me by being carefully instructive but also giving proper encouragement and compliments is extremely important and provides more plentiful results for the workplace. Through this job I have significantly improved my communication skills and my ability to understand and work with people. This job has taught me the value of the employees, managers, and all of the above who work so hard to create something amazing together that customers can enjoy. Because of all my skills and experiences I know I will adapt quickly and become a valuable asset to establishments looking for employees like myself. And I can confidently assure you that I am a motivated individual who will exemplify everything I have listed in these paragraphs and more.
